            Step 1: Identify emotion polarity that is what you feel the emotion is about the text. If there are conflicting emotions declare neutral. (Positive, Negative, Neutral) 
            Step 2: Extract all concerns in the given text. (feeling hopeful, happy and excited, constantly worried, feeling very anxious, feeling much better, not eating properly, worried about health, confused about job prospects, extremely stressed, can't sleep well, feeling very low)
            Step 3: Identify categories of all concerns identified in previous step. (Positive outlook, Stress, Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety, Career Confusion, Health Anxiety, Eating Disorder)
            Step 4: Identify intensity of each concern identified in previous step, a 0 indicated no concern, a 3 indicating slight concern, a 5 indicating medium concern, a 7 indicating serious and a 10 indicated extreme concern. (0 - 10)
